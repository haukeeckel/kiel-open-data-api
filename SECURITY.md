# Security Policy

## Purpose

This document defines how to report security issues for this repository and
what maintainers do after receiving a report.

## Supported Versions

| Version             | Supported |
| ------------------- | --------- |
| `main`              | yes       |
| older branches/tags | no        |

Security fixes are developed on `main`. Backports are not guaranteed.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities privately.

- Preferred: use GitHub Security Advisories for this repository.
- If advisories are not available, contact the maintainers directly.

Do not publish proof-of-concept code, exploit details, or full impact analysis
in public issues before a fix is available.

When possible, include:

- affected endpoint or component
- reproduction steps
- expected vs. actual behavior
- potential impact
- environment details (version, runtime, configuration)

## Disclosure

We follow coordinated disclosure:

- maintainers validate and triage the report
- a fix is prepared and released
- details are disclosed publicly after remediation is available

This policy is intentionally lean and does not define hard response SLAs.
